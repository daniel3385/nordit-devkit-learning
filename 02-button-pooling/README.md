# Button and LED Example (Switch 0) using pooling

This project is a simple application that **reads the button Switch 0** and **turns on the LED when the button is pressed**.

The button state is monitored using a GPIO input, and the LED is controlled through a GPIO output.  
When Switch 0 is pressed, the LED turns on. When the button is released, the LED turns off.

This project was created for learning and testing purposes.
