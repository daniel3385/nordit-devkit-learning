This repository contains my notes, experiments, and source code while learning to use the Nordit platform and its development kit nFR52840-DK.

## Goals

- Learn how to set up the development environment
- Run and understand practical examples (LEDs, sensors, communication)
- Document common errors and solutions
- Build a personal knowledge base on embedded development with Nordit
