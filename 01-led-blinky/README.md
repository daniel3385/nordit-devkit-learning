# Nordic Blinky LED Example

This project is a simple **LED blink (blinky)** application based on the **official Nordic Semiconductor example**.

I used the Nordic SDK example to understand the basic structure of the project and how to control GPIO pins.  
The LED blinks at a fixed interval defined in SLEEP_TIME_MS, demonstrating that the board and development environment are working correctly.

This project was created for learning and testing purposes.

## Based on
- Nordic Semiconductor Zephyr Blinky Example

## Features
- LED on/off blinking
- Uses Nordic SDK example code
